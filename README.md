# Properties of GeTe ad T=0K and at T=1150K

In the following repository, the study of GeTe electronic, phonons and structural properties is performed via DFT, by use of QE and CP2K.
- **simulations**: Includes all the inputs for electronic bands, dos, phonons (QE) and BO dynamics (CP2K)
- **analysis**: Includes all the .tcl (VMD) and python3 scripts used for the analysis
